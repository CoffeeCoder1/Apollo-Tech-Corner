# About the weblog

A while ago, it was suggested by a friend that I should start a blog to document my projects and stuff, and I thought 'that's not a bad idea'. So, I created this.

If you notice a bug or want a feature implement, report or request it [here](https://github.com/CoffeeCoder1/Apollo-Tech-Corner/issues). Feel free to fix things and submit a pull request as well.

Note: Apollo is from my name, not the lunar landers.
