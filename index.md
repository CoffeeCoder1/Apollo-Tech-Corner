haii! i'm a fops :3

i do some things with tech and music, and i'm pretty interested in audio stuff.

you can find a bunch of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/CoffeeCoder1)
and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/CoffeeCoder1), and anything else i post can be
found on the [profiles page]({{ site.baseurl }}/profiles.html).

i also stream [on twitch](https://twitch.tv/apollofops) pretty regularly (i try
my best to adhere to the schedule on my twitch page, and i add in some bonus
streams sometimes too). feel free to join in if you wanna watch me fail at
playing video games (and also do whatever else i feel like doing).

if you happen to want to contact me, you can send an e-mail to apollo [at] {this
domain} or message me through one of [these services]({{ site.baseurl }}/profiles.html#messaging).
