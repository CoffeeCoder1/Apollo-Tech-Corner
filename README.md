# Apollo Tech Corner

This is just a little homepage and blog I created for myself a little while ago. You can see it hosted at [apollofops.net](https://apollofops.net), and if you find any problems feel free to submit an issue or a patch.

## Build instructions

This can either be built with Jekyll directly (check the instructions in the Jekyll documentation to see how to do this), or it can be built with the Dockerfile provided (just run `docker compose up` to build).
