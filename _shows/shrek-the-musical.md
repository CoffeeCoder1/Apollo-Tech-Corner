For this show, I was the lead lighting designer and board operator. This was my
first time ever doing lighting things (or even doing theatre tech things at
all!), so it wasn't fantastic, but I definitely had fun doing it and I learned a
lot about how lighting stuff works.

We used a Strand Lighting board of some variety for this (w/ broken faders) in
two-scene mode, which was..."Fun" to use lol (it had a tendency to drift from
whatever values you set it to). Oh also I would've used scenes but that board
didn't really do that.
