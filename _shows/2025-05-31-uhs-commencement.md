title: UHS Commencement (Class of 2025)
---

I was a part of the livestream team for UHS's 2025 commencement ceremonies.

Prior to the event, I helped with planning out what equipment we were going to
use, and I also designed a TouchDesigner patch which we used to run the lower
thirds graphics. During the event itself, I ended up mixing the video for the
stream.
