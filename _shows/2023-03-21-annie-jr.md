For this show, I was the lead lighting designer. This was my second time doing
lighting things, so they weren't great lol, but I had fun at least. We had just
upgraded to a new ETC Express board (well, new to us, I think it dated back to
the late 90s), so this was also my introduction to ETC systems.
