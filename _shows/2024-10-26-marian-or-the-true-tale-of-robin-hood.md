title: Marian (Or the True Tale of Robin Hood)
location: University High School

For this show, I mainly just found and ran audio cues. We didn't mic the talent
for this, so that was kinda all there was left for me. Also, I helped with
focusing lights for this show, including helping out a bit with choosing out
and installing some foresty gobos which looked pretty neat (and a very nice
looking blue-gelled jail light).
