For this production of Annie, I mixed all of the talent mics and also found and
ran a few audio cues. Also, I helped manage all of the mics and beltpacks, and
I helped a lot with focusing (and a bit with programming) lights in the weeks
leading up to the show.

This show was particularly special because we actually completely ran out of
inputs on the board! We had 17 beltpacks, a special radio mic used for one
scene, and also the entire orchestra was miked, so we used all 33 inputs
available to us. And we still weren't able to mic everyone lol.
